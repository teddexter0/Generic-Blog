        Why Scientists Believe This Regular Meal Kills Cancers

    </h5>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cancer is one of the most challenging diseases facing humanity, but scientific studies are uncovering powerful, natural tools in the fight against it. Recently, researchers have focused on the anti-cancer properties of specific foods, such as broccoli, turmeric, and green tea.
<br>
        One particularly promising discovery highlights a combination of cruciferous vegetables like kale and broccoli, rich in sulforaphane—a compound shown to slow the growth of cancer cells. Adding foods high in antioxidants, such as berries and walnuts, further strengthens the meal’s protective effects.
        <br>      
        Studies have also suggested that regularly eating a Mediterranean diet, which is high in healthy fats from olive oil, whole grains, and fish, could significantly reduce cancer risk by lowering inflammation and oxidative stress.
        <br>    
        While no single meal guarantees immunity from cancer, consistently incorporating such foods into your diet may help prevent or even fight cancer development. Scientists are hopeful that dietary changes can be a key addition to modern cancer therapies.

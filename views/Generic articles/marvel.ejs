        What’s Really Happened to Marvel Since ‘The Blip’?
    </h5>

    <p>
        Since the infamous "Blip" in Avengers: Endgame, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has undergone a dramatic transformation. The return of half the universe’s population brought joy but also chaos, as characters grapple with rebuilding their lives.

        In terms of storytelling, Marvel has shifted focus from the original Avengers to a new generation of heroes. Movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Disney+ series such as WandaVision and Loki have expanded the MCU into multiverse storytelling, bringing alternate realities and timelines into the spotlight.

        Behind the scenes, Marvel has faced challenges with audience fatigue, balancing quantity and quality as the MCU grows. While recent films have received mixed reviews, fan favorites like Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 have kept excitement alive.

        Marvel’s next phase hints at major developments with Kang the Conqueror and the Fantastic Four entering the picture. The Blip may be over, but its ripple effects will likely shape Marvel’s universe for years to come.

# Generic-Blog-Project
#This is a generic blog website featuring a visually engaging UI with responsive design elements throughout.

# Project Front end contents
Includes a horizontal navigation bar, generic image-based articles, an image slider, and a footer. The site includes a gradient animated background and a humorous sliding banner visible upon page load.

# Backend functionality
The backend integrates user registration and login functionality, securely storing emails and passwords using salted hashing, managed via pgAdmin and PostgreSQL. OAuth 2.0 is implemented for third-party logins with providers such as Google, Instagram, and Facebook.

#Users can create posts using a predefined template with fields for heading, date, author name, and post topic. Posts intentionally omit images for simplicity and uniformity in design.

#The project leverages a modern tech stack, including Node.js for server-side logic, Bcrypt for password hashing, npm for package management, and EJS for templating. Postman is used for API testing, while pgAdmin supports database management.

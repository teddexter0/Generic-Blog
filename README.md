## **Known Issues**

1. **Missing Notifications**:
   - No confirmation message for email reset link sent to the inbox.
   - No notification when a new password is saved.
2. **Authorization Flaws**:
   - Ineffective validation of account ownership during password resets.
3. **Password Confirmation**:
   - "Confirm password" feature is not implemented effectively.
4. **Code Organization**:
   - `app.js` contains all server-side logic, leading to a monolithic structure.
   - Too many CSS files, causing maintainability issues.
   - Some EJS files are not nested properly, affecting structure and reusability.
5. **Visual Glitch**:
   - Gradient transitions experience slight hitches on some mobile devices.

### **Planned Fixes**

- Add user notifications for critical actions (e.g., password resets).
- Implement secure authorization for password reset using unique tokens.
- Refactor `app.js` into modular components.
- Consolidate and optimize CSS files.
- Nest EJS files into logical subfolders.
- Optimize CSS transitions for smoother gradient animations.
